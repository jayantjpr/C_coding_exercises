In this exercise, we'll update the API to take care of updating the head pointer
of the singly linked list. Instead of accepting a pointer to the head node, the
API methods should accept a pointer to pointer of the head node (Node **head)
and update the pointer to the head node from within the API call. e.g.:

// Adds a new Node with the given data at the front of the list and returns a
// pointer to the new node.
//
// Passing NULL head creates a new list.
Node* push_front(Node** head, int data);

The caller would then could then use the API as follows to print the list
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9:

int n = 10;
Node* head = NULL;
while(n--) {
  push_front(&head, n);
}
print(head);

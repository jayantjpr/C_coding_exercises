We'll add two more basic functions to our API.

1 - Given two singly linked list find whether they're identical or not. Two
linked lists are identical when they have the same data in the same order.

// Return true if both linked lists are identical else return false.
bool areIdentical(Node *head1, Node *head2)

2 - Find the node at the given index (1 based index) of linked list. The caller
needs to ensure that the index <= length of the list.

// Returns data of node at given index.
//
// This function assumes that there are at least index number of nodes in linked
// list.
int getNth(Node* head, int index)

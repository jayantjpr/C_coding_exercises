In the previous created singly list API, add the following functions:

// Prints the elements of the list in the format "x y z".
print(Node* head)

// Counts the number of nodes in the linked list.
int length(Node* head)

Do take into account the case of an empty list.
After implementing this function, locally test your code with an few test cases.

== DON'T read this part till you've implemented the solution yourself. ==
Submit your code for the print function at
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-linked-list-elements/1 and
length function at
https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-nodes-of-linked-list/1. You
could login with your google account to submit. Don't read any comments till
you've made a successful submittions for both.

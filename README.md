# C_coding_exercises
My codes when learning C in B.Tech.

## Organization
* exercise - contains exercises in txt files related to various topics.
* src - source code for the exercises.

There is _no_ one to one map between the exercises and the source files. The same source file could be modified incrementally for multiple exercises to reach a final form. e.g. src/list/list.c get updated incrementally for exercises in exercise/list.
